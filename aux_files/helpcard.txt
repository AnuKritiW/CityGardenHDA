== Visualizing the results ==

This node has two outputs -- `(0) garden` and `(1) fireworks`.

[Image:city_garden::1.0/city-garden-node.png]

The best way to visualize both with good performance is to:

# Create a separate Geometry node (`geo_fireworks`) at the object level 

    [Image:city_garden::1.0/geo-nodes.png]

# In that node, create an object merge that references the `(1) fireworks` output

    [Image:city_garden::1.0/object-merge-node.png]

# Return to the object level and view both Geometry nodes simultaneously

Range of Scale:
    #id: scale_range_skimmia
    
    Specifies the variation in scale among all <<Skimmia Bushes>>.
    
    :box:
        #display: bordered gray
        
        Range: `[0, ∞)`

Seed:
    #id: seed_skimmia
    
    This parameter randomnizes the placement of the <<Skimmia Bushes>>.
    
    NOTE:
        When painting multiple plants over each other, the plants may at times overlap. Adjust this setting as needed to get the desired placement.   
~~~

Replace with File:
    #id: replace_skimmia
    
    Enables the option to replace the <<Skimmia Bush>> with an external geometry file. 
    
    NOTE:
        Replacing the <<Skimmia Bush>> with an external geometry disables certain editable parameters.

Geometry File:
    #id: file_skimmia
    
    Specifies the external geometry file to replace the <<Skimmia Bush>>.
    
    This field is enabled only when the <<Replace with File>> is checked. 

Reload Geometry:
    #id: reload_skimmia

    Forces a reload of the specified geometry file. This action also clears any cached data associated with packed disk primitives.
    
    This field is enabled only when the <<Replace with File>> is checked.

~~~Transform Geometry~~~

This section provides parameters to modify the position, orientation, and size of the loaded geometry. 

NOTE:
    This section appears only after <<Replace with File>> is enabled.
    
NOTE:
    These transformations are applied to the geometry *before* the enabled parameters defined above, such as <<Range of Rotation>> and <<Range of Scale>>.

Translate:
    #id: t_skimmia
    
    Translates the geometry along the xyz axes.

Rotate:
    #id: r_skimmia
    
    Rotates the geometry along the xyz axes.

Scale:
    #id: s_skimmia
    
    Non-uniform scaling along the xyz axes.

====Area Patches====

<<Area Patches>> are designated regions within which specified plants are distributed. These areas can optionally include a raised platform beneath the plants to create a refined, manicured appearance for the greenery in the scene.

Similar to how *Groups* operate in [Supertree Groups|#supertree_grp], each of the three *Groups* here allow for a distinct variation in <<Area Patches>>.

NOTE:
    Each group can contain multiple <<Area Patches>>, depending on how the curves are drawn.

:fig:[Image:city_garden::1.0/areapatch.png]

~~~Groups 1/2/3~~~

Plant Toggles:
    Palm Trees:
        Enables or disables the addition of <<Palm Trees>> to the selected <<Area Patches>>.
        
    Grass:
        Enables or disables the addition of <<Grass>> Tufts to the selected <<Area Patches>>.
        
    Orchids:
        Enables or disables the addition of <<Orchids>> to the selected <<Area Patches>>.
        
    Skimmia Bush:
        Enables or disables the addition of <<Skimmia Bushes>> to the selected <<Area Patches>>.

Draw Curve:
    Activates the curve drawing tool to outline the shape of an <<Area Patch>> on the ground plane.

    NOTE:
        Entering the curve tool opens the node's graph view. After completing the curve, navigate up one level to return to the HDA parameter interface.
        
    TIP:
        To achieve the best results, draw curves that outline the intended polygons for the scene. 
        
        While curves do not need to be closed, ensuring closure prevents nearby patches from being grouped together inadvertently.

Edit Curve:
    Activates the curve editing tool to modify existing curves on the ground plane. <<Area Patches>> automatically adapt to the changes made to these curves.
    
    NOTE:
        Entering the curve tool opens the node's graph view. After editing the curve, navigate up one level to return to the HDA parameter interface.

Clear:
    Clear <<Area Patch>> curves.
        
~~~

The parameters in this section are enabled if at least one of the plants is selected under <<Plant Toggles>>.

Density Scale:
    Adjusts the density of the selected <<Plants>> within the painted regions.
    
    :box:
        #display: bordered gray
        
        Range: `[0.001, ∞)`
        
Range of Rotation:
    Specifies the variation in rotation among all the selected <<Plants>>. 
    
    :box:
        #display: bordered gray
        
        Range: `[-180, 180]`
        
    TIP:
        Set to `[0, 0]` to have all the <<Plants>> facing the same direction.
        
Range of Scale:
    Specifies the variation in scale among all the selected <<Plants>>.
    
    :box:
        #display: bordered gray
        
        Range: `[0, ∞)`

Inward Offset:
    Sets the distance from the edge of the Area Patch where plants will not be placed. A higher value increases the buffer zone near the edges, reducing plant placement in those areas.

    :box:
        #display: bordered gray
        
        Range: `[0, ∞)`

Supertree Clearance:
    This parameter determines the distance around <<Supertrees>> where <<Plants>> cannot be placed. When a <<Supertree>> is placed on an <<Area patch>>, this parameter sets how far out the exclusion zone extends, ensuring <<Plants>> do not overlap with the <<Supertree>>.

    :box:
        #display: bordered gray
        
        Range: `[0, ∞)`
~~~

Hide Base:
    Checking this toggle hides the base of the <<Area Patch>>.
    
    NOTE:
        Checking this toggle will disable the remaining paramters in this section.
        
Base Colour:
    Determines the colour of the base <<Area Patch>>.
        
Base Height:
    Adjust to set the height of the base.
    
    :box:
        #display: bordered gray
        
        Range: `[0.01, ∞)`

===Fireworks===

Fireworks are a staple of celebrations along the vibrant Singapore skyline, with Gardens by the Bay often serving as a stunning backdrop. This section lets you integrate dynamic fireworks into your garden scene, capturing the festive spirit of Singapore's iconic views.

:video:
    #src: city_garden::1.0/fireworks3.mp4

<<Fireworks>> have two colours -- <<Colour 1>> and <<Colour 2>>. 
    
Colour 1 Ramp:
    #id: color_ramp_1
    
    Defines the gradient for the first set of fireworks, allowing you to customize their colour transitions.
    
    :box:
        #display: bordered gray:
        
        By default, gradient from 
        
        `RGB(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)` (_Yellow_) -> `RGB(1.0, 0.5, 0.0)` (_Orange_) -> `RGB(1.0, 0.3, 0.0)` (_Darker Orange_)
        
        evenly spaced.
        
Colour 2 Ramp:
    #id: color_ramp_2
    
    Defines the gradient for the second set of fireworks, allowing you to customize their colour transitions.
    
    :box:
        #display: bordered gray:
        
        By default, gradient from 
        
        `RGB(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)` (_White_) -> `RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)` (_Red_) -> `RGB(0.2, 0.0, 0.0)` (_Darker Red_)
        
        evenly spaced.

~~~Cache Settings~~~

Load from Disk:
    #id: loadfromdisk
    
    When this is on, the node reads its output from the cached disk files, rather than cooking its input.
    When you click <<Save to Disk>> or <<Save to Disk in Background>> to write out the cache files, the node automatically turns this checkbox on.

Reload Geometry:
    #id: reload_geo
    
    Force a reload of the file. This will also clear any cached data for packed disk primitives.
    
Geometry File:
    #id: fireworks_cache_file
    
    This node uses the file path expression to generate the cache file path(s). This expression should include all the variables you want in the path (including the frame number when Time dependent cache is on)
    
    :box:
        #display: bordered gray
        
        `$HIP/cache/$OS/$OS.$F.bgeo.sc` by default, where `$HIP` is the project directory.

Open Directory:
    This parameter provides a convenient way to open the directory containing the cached fireworks geometry. It uses the path specified in the Geometry File parameter. Clicking this button opens the directory in your system’s file explorer, making it easier to locate and manage the cached files.
    
~~~Cache Controls~~~

This is a subsection of <<Cache Settings>>.

TIP:
    <<Cache Controls>> subsection is collapsible to prevent accidental clicking and rebuilding of the cache.

Save to Disk:
    #id: execute
    
    Saves the geometry to disk with the last control settings.

Save to Disk in Background:
    #id: cookoutputnode
    
    Use a TOP network to cook and save the cache files to disk in a separate background process. This allows you to keep working on other parts of Houdini. The cached frames will show up as they are completed by the other process.
    
Cancel Cook:
    #id: dirtyall
    
    Stops all background caching processes, if any exist.

===Render===

Render View:
    Clicking this button changes the view to the Render view. Set the Renderer to <<Karma CPU>> if not already set.
    
    NOTE:
        Your current Context View should change. If it does not, modify the pane settings to link to the network view pane.

    NOTE:
        Clicking this button enters the LOP Network of this node. Navigate up two levels to return to the HDA parameter interface.
    
~~~Sky Appearance~~~

This section exposes certain parameters from the [karma physical sky node|Node:lop/karmaphysicalsky].

Disable Physical Sky:
    When checked, this toggle disables the Physical Sky in the render view.
    
    NOTE:
        Checking this toggle disables the rest of the parameters in this section.

Time:
    Specify the time of the day to determine the sky’s colours. The dropdown menu lets you switch between *24hr*, *AM* and *PM* time displays.
        
Turbidity:
    Measure of the aerosol content of the air which defines the sky appearance.
    
    :box:
        #display: bordered gray
        
        Range: `[1, ∞)`
